-----------------------

In my role as Project Coordinator at and architecture office, I worked on designing buildings that met client needs and followed city bylaws. Looking back, I see ways to include more focus on ethics and fairness in my work.

To be more ethical, I would prioritize using sustainable materials and making our buildings energy-efficient. This helps protect the environment and reduces our projectsâ€™ impact on nature. I would also ensure that all decisions are transparent, keeping clients and team members informed about the choices we make and their effects.

Addressing fairness means making our designs accessible to everyone. I would involve different community members, especially those from underrepresented groups, to understand their needs better. This could involve holding meetings to gather their feedback and making sure our buildings are usable for people with disabilities and other specific requirements.

By focusing more on sustainability and including diverse voices in the design process, I believe we can create buildings that are not only beautiful and functional but also fair and responsible. These changes would help build a more inclusive and ethical approach to architecture.

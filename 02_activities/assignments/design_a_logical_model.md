# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model
### By: Brigitte Yan 

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?
```
Yes, retaining customer addresses, especially in Type 2, has privacy implications:

- **Data Retention**: Historical addresses remain in the system even after updates, potentially violating data minimization laws like GDPR or CCPA, where customers can request data deletion.
- **Data Breaches**: More stored addresses mean more sensitive data at risk in a breach, which could be exploited for fraud or identity theft.
- **Compliance**: Retaining old addresses may require explicit consent, and companies must ensure compliance with privacy laws.

Type 1 (overwrite) reduces exposure by only storing the current address but limits tracking of historical changes.
```

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMu4W.gif)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?
